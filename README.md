# Subnet_IP_Scanner
This project implements a Subnet IP Scanner to identify active hosts within a given subnet by sending ICMP Echo Request packets and processing ICMP Echo Reply responses. The scanner is designed to operate efficiently within a confined subnet, leveraging raw sockets and libpcap for packet handling.
